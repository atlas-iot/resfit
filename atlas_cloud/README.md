# ATLAS Cloud
ATLAS Cloud is a SaaS portal used to manage ([ATLAS_Gateway]) and ([ATLAS_Client]) devices. The portal permits visualizing gateways and IoT client device telemetry data in **real-time**. More specifically, the portal allows the following main functions:
* add gateways to the platform using a unique identity and a pre-shared key
* visualize the gateway connection health
* visualize the IoT clients connected to the gateway
* visualize the IoT client connection health with the gateway
* visualize the IoT client system telemetry data (e.g. number of processes, used memory)
* visualize the IoT client network information: statistics collected from the IoT device and firewall statistics (ingress/egress passed and dropped packets) collected from the gateway MQTT firewall. 
* visualize the IoT device reputation: system reputation (evaluates the client behavior in the system using metrics like connection health and number of packets accepted by other nodes) and sensor reputation (evaluates the quality of sensor generated data).
* inspect the network statistics and reputation history in a real-time updated chart

The ATLAS Cloud portal communicates with the gateways using a TLS secured MQTT protocol and the user-interface web application is accessed by an administrator using a client digital certificate.

### Prerequisites
 Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites:
 - Apache Tomcat 9 - https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi
 -- In order to configure the TLS Tomcat connector, the following packages must be installed:
```
sudo apt-get install libapr1 libapr1-dev libtcnative-1
```

 - MongoDB
```
sudo apt-get install mongodb
```
 - Mosquitto MQTT broker 1.6.8+. In order to install the required version, the following repository must be added (Mosquitto version can be verified using `/usr/sbin/mosquitto -v`):
```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mosquitto-dev/mosquitto-ppa
sudo apt-get install mosquitto
```
- Mosquitto client tools must be installed (mosquitto_passwd tool is required). These should be installed along with the Mosquitto broker.

- For the `push notification` mechanism, ATLAS Cloud requires a valid Firebase connection. To configure this connection, please copy the private key exported from the Google Firebase platform, as a JSON file, in the following folder: https://github.com/atlas-iot/resfit/tree/master/atlas_cloud/atlas-web/src/main/resources/google. For detailed instructions on how to obtain this JSON file, please refer to the [Google Firebase guides].

---

### Configuration
 The following elements must be configured before building and deploying the application:
1. Validate the following fields from the `atlas-web/src/main/resources/application.properties` file
 - The `atlas-cloud.passwordTool` field indicates the full path to the `mosquitto_passwd` utility tool (replace this if necessary). The full path of the binary can be found using the following command `which mosquitto_passwd`.
```
atlas-cloud.passwordTool = /usr/local/bin/mosquitto_passwd
```
 - The `atlas-cloud.tmpDir` field indicates a temporary directory which must be accessed by the Tomcat user - Read/Write/Execute permissions (replace this if necessary)
```
atlas-cloud.tmpDir = /tmp
```
2. Generate the server and client certificates along with the certificate chain. The web application uses a server certificate and a client certificate (mutual TLS authentication).
The following script must be executed to generate the certificates:
```
cd misc/scripts/pki
pki_init.sh
```
This script will generate the following certificates: a *ROOT CA*, an *intermediate CA (server sub-CA)* which signs the server certificate, an *intermediate CA (client sub-CA)* which signs the client certificate, the *server certificate* and the *client certificate*.
The `pkit_init.sh` script will prompt for a set of default information for the certificate authorities (can be used as default), a **FQDN** for the server certificate and a **fullname (with no spaces)** for the client certificate.
The PKI script will create the following directories:
* `misc/scripts/pki/ca` - this directory holds the certificate and private keys for the ROOT CA, server sub-CA and client sub-CA
* `misc/scripts/pki/artifacts` - this directory holds the generated server and client certificates as follows:
  * `client.truststore.pem` - this file contains the certificate truststore (contains the ROOT certificate and the server sub-CA certificate) which must be deployed on the **ATLAS Gateway** side.
  * `server.truststore.pem` - this file contains the certificate truststore (contains the ROOT certificate and the client sub-CA certificate) which must be deployed on the **Tomcat server**. This is used to valide the client certificate which accesses the web application using mutual authentication TLS.
  * `clients` - this directory contains one or more client certificate directories which are named with the client **Fullname**. Each client certificate directory contains the following files:
    * `<Fullname>.chain.pem` - this file contains the certificate chain for the client (contains the ROOT certificate and the client sub-CA certificate)
    * `<Fullname>.crt.pem` - this file contains the client certificate
    * `<Fullname>.key.pem` - this file contains the client private key
    * `<Fullname>.p12` - this file contains the client certificate and the private key in a PKCS#12 format (encrypted with the password required by the `pki_init.sh` script)
  * `servers` - this directory contains one or more server certificate directories which are named with the server **FQDN**. Each server certificate directory contains the following file:
    * `<FQDN>.chain.pem` - this file contains the certificate chain for the client (contains the ROOT certificate and the server sub-CA certificate)
    * `<FQDN>.crt.pem` - this file contains the server certificate
    * `<FQDN>.key.pem` - this file contains the server private key
---

### Build
  The application is build using the following command:
  ```
    cd atlas-web
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
  ```

---

### Deployment
1. Deploy the *Mosquitto* files
* Run the `deploy.sh` script, which will install a *credentials reload script* and a wrapper executable for the *credentials reload script* in `usr/local/sbin`. The `deploy.sh` script will also install the mosquitto config file in `/etc/mosquitto` directory.
* Copy the server certificate and private key into `/etc/mosquitto/certs` directory as follows:
```
cp misc/scripts/pki/artifacts/servers/<FQDN>/<FQDN>.chain.pem /etc/mosquitto/certs/server.chain.pem
cp misc/scripts/pki/artifacts/servers/<FQDN>/<FQDN>.crt.pem /etc/mosquitto/certs/server.crt.pem
cp misc/scripts/pki/artifacts/servers/<FQDN>/<FQDN>.key.pem /etc/mosquitto/certs/server.key.pem
```
* Restart Mosquitto using `systemctl restart mosquitto`. Verify that Mosquitto is running using `systemctl status mosquitto` and that Mosquitto is listening on ports 1883 and 8883 using `sudo netstat -plotnu | grep 1883` and `sudo netstat -plotnu | grep 8883`
2. Copy the generated WAR application **atlas-cloud-1.0.war** into the Tomcat webapps directory as **ROOT.war**
3. Copy the Tomcat config from `misc/config/tomcat/server.xml` into Tomcat **conf** directory.
4. Copy the server certificate and private key along with the server truststore into the Tomcat **conf** directory as follows:
```
cp misc/scripts/pki/artifacts/server.truststore.pem <Tomcat dir>/conf/server.truststore.pem
cp misc/scripts/pki/artifacts/servers/<FQDN>/<FQDN>.chain.pem <Tomcat dir>/conf/server.chain.pem
cp misc/scripts/pki/artifacts/servers/<FQDN>/<FQDN>.crt.pem <Tomcat dir>/conf/server.crt.pem
cp misc/scripts/pki/artifacts/servers/<FQDN>/<FQDN>.key.pem <Tomcat dir>/conf/server.key.pem
```
5. Start the Tomcat server using `bin/startup.sh` from the Tomcat directory.
6. Install the client certificate `misc/scripts/pki/artifacts/clients/<Fullname>/<Fullname>.p12` into a browser in order to access the web application.
